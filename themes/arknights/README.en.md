  site_name: My Blog # 站点名称，用于区分多个站点（可选）
```

## Mathematical formulas

The theme supports two scenarios for displaying math formulas:  

### Option 1: Static rendering

You can use [hexo-filter-mathjax](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-filter-mathjax) filter to render math formulas statically:  

It is recommended to replace the markdown renderer [hexo-renderer-pandoc](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-renderer-pandoc) that can better handle mathematical formulas first.

1. Run the following commands in your Hexo directory:  

   ```shell script
   # Install hexo-filter-mathjax
   cnpm install hexo-filter-mathjax --save
   # Clean the cache
   hexo clean
   ```

2. Add the following into `Hexo/_config.yml`:  

   ```yaml
   mathjax:
     tags: none # or 'ams' or 'all'
     single_dollars: true # use single '$' as inline math formula delimiter
     cjk_width: 0.9 # Relatively CJK character width
     normal_width: 0.6 # Relatively normal width
     append_css: true # Add CSS to every pages
     every_page: false # If true, then every page will be rendered by mathjax, regardless of the `mathjax` setting in the front-matter of each article
   ```

3. Add `mathjax: true` in the [Front-matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter) of article that requires mathjax to be enabled:  

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies
   categories: Physics
   date: 1905-06-30 12:00:00
   mathjax: true
   ---
   ```

   Then, you can use LaTeX in your articles.  

4. Please note that inline math formulas (… `$<math formula>$` ...) cannot have spaces after the opening `$` and before the closing `$`! For example:  

   ```diff
   - $ \epsilon_0 $
   + $\epsilon_0$
   - $ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} $
   + $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$
   ```

5. Be aware of the conflict between LaTeX and Markdown syntax. Use `\` to escape if necessary:  

   ```diff
   - $\epsilon_0$
   + $\epsilon\_0$
   - \begin{eqnarray*}
   + \begin{eqnarray\*}
   ```

### Option 2: Dynamic rendering

The theme also supports [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), to dynamically render formulas as the user browses:

1. First, uninstall the hexo-renderer-marked renderer that comes with Hexo by default, and replace with [hexo-renderer-kramed](https://github.com/sun11/hexo-renderer-kramed) with better MathJax support:  

   ```shell
   npm uninstall hexo-renderer-marked --save
   npm install hexo-renderer-kramed --save
   ```

2. Edit `_config.arknights.yml` in your **Hexo directory**:  

   ```diff
     # Formula support
     mathjax:
   -   enable: false
   +   enable: true
       version: '2.6.1'  # important
   ```

3. Then, you can use LaTeX in your articles:  

   ```latex
   % Single-line inline formula
   % Note that you need to put "`" on both sides, and there can be no space between "`" and "$"
   `$\sigma$`
   
   % Multi-line formula
   $$
   \begin{aligned}f(x) &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}{\frac{x}{2^i}} \\
   &= x\end{aligned}
   $$
   ```

4. With this scheme, there will be no conflict between LaTeX and Markdown syntax. Escaping is not required to use LaTeX syntax in the text.  
   The following formulas can be used directly without any problems:  

   ```latex
   \epsilon_0
   \begin{eqnarray*}
   ```

The hexo-renderer-kramed plugin has other configurable items, please refer to the plugin documentation: https://github.com/sun11/hexo-renderer-kramed  

Advantages and disadvantages of these formula display schemes:  

1. Dynamic rendering does not require escaping, and can better support Markdown files exported from other places. But since it needs to be rendered in the browser, the page display will be slightly delayed.  
2. The static rendering compiles the formula directly into the static file, which has better display performance, but the syntax needs to be escaped.  
3. [hexo-renderer-pandoc](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-renderer-pandoc) quickly displays formulas without having to go through the hassle of escaping syntax, but requires Pandoc to be installed.

## Chart support

Edit `_config.arknights.yml` in your **Hexo directory**:  

```diff
  # Chart support
  mermaid:
-   enable: false
+   enable: true
    version: '8.13.5'
```

The theme renders various charts via mermaid-js. **[Examples](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/)**

Supports:
[Flow Chart](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/#%E6%B5%81%E7%A8%8B%E5%9B%BE)
| [Sequence Diagram](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/#%E5%BA%8F%E5%88%97%E5%9B%BE)
| [Class Diagram](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/#%E7%B1%BB%E5%9B%BE)
| [State Diagram](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/#%E7%8A%B6%E6%80%81%E5%9B%BE)
| [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/#%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%9B%BE)
| [User Journey Map](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/#%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E6%97%85%E7%A8%8B%E5%9B%BE)
| [Gantt Chart](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/#%E7%94%98%E7%89%B9%E5%9B%BE)
| [Instruction Map](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/#%E6%8C%87%E4%BB%A4%E5%9B%BE)
| [Pie Chart](https://arknights.theme.hexo.yue.zone/mermaid/#%E9%A5%BC%E5%9B%BE)

Syntax:

```html
<div class="mermaid">
  graph LR
  A[Hard edge] -->|Link text| B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C -->|One| D[Result one]
  C -->|Two| E[Result two]
</div>
```

> It is also fully supported if you are used to using `code blocks`.  

## Word count & Reading time statistics

Depends [`hexo-wordcount`](https://github.com/willin/hexo-wordcount):

For npm users:

```shell script
cnpm install hexo-wordcount --save
```

For yarn users:

```shell script
yarn add hexo-wordcount
```

Then edit `_config.arknights.yml` in your **Hexo directory**:

```yaml
post:
  count: true # Display word count
  time: true # Display reading time statistics
```

## Views statistics

Use [不蒜子](http://busuanzi.ibruce.info/) for page view statistics.
Modify the `_config.arknights.yml` file in the **Hexo directory** to enable this feature:

```yaml
busuanzi:
  enable: false
  sitePV: true # Total Site Visits
  siteUV: true # Number of site visitors
  pagePV: true # Page Views
```

## Document encryption

The modified [hexo-blog-encrypt](https://github.com/D0n9X1n/hexo-blog-encrypt) plugin has been adapted and integrated into this theme (currently only the default and up themes are supported).

> For detailed configuration reference [hexo-blog-encrypt](https://github.com/D0n9X1n/hexo-blog-encrypt)

Add the following to the `Hexo/_config.yml` file:

```yml
# Security
encrypt: # hexo-blog-encrypt
  abstract: Password required for weak neural connection to Rhodes Island™
  message: Please enter password for weak neural connection to Rhodes Island™
  tags:
  - {name: tagName, password: PassowrdA}
  - {name: tagName, password: PasswordB}
  wrong_pass_message: Failed to verify password with Rhodes Island™, please try again.
  wrong_hash_message: Failed to validate password with Rhodes Island™, currently viewing with temporary privileges.
```

**Or** Set the following in [Front-matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter) of the artical:  

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
tags:
- Encrypted as a diary
date: 2016-03-30 21:12:21
password: mikemessi
abstract: Password required for weak neural connection to Rhodes Island™
message: Please enter password for weak neural connection to Rhodes Island™
wrong_pass_message: Failed to verify password with Rhodes Island™, please try again.
wrong_hash_message: Failed to validate password with Rhodes Island™, currently viewing with temporary privileges.

```yaml
search:
  enable: false
```

## Front-matter

In addition to [Front-matter supported by Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter), the theme also supports:  

```yaml
# Published/updated date in the top right corner of the article page
post-info: true/false

# Sidebar table of contents
post-index: true/false

# Rewards
reward: true/false
```

## Import custom CSS/JS files

You can put your own CSS snippets into `Hexo/source/css/`;  
put JavaScript file into `Hexo/source/js/`;  

Then edit `Hexo/_config.arknights.yml`:  

```diff
  # Include CSS stylesheets inside `<head>` tags
  stylesheets:
  - //unpkg.com/@highlightjs/cdn-assets@11.4.0/styles/atom-one-dark-reasonable.min.css

| gh-pages | gh-page hosting                                                   |
| hexo     | Hexo directory, where you can fine `.md` files to test your theme |

### Bugs and solutions that may encounter during development

#### Modified TS file does not take effect

TypeScript needs to be compiled manually, please install `typescript` globally and execute `tsc` in the `arknights\source\js\_src` directory to compile it.

#### Long articles are not fully rendered when running 'hexo serve --debug'

This is caused by `hexo-browsersync`, and will not affect the release.

Workaround: Disable the plugin. (Anyway, it doesn't affect the release, no matter what)
